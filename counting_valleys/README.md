# [Counting Valleys](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/counting-valleys/problem)

An avid hiker keeps meticulous records of their hikes. During the last hike that took exactly __steps__ steps, for every step it was noted if it was an uphill, __U__, or a downhill, __D__ step. Hikes always start and end at sea level, and each step up or down represents a __1__ unit change in altitude. We define the following terms:

A mountain is a sequence of consecutive steps above sea level, starting with a step up from sea level and ending with a step down to sea level.
A valley is a sequence of consecutive steps below sea level, starting with a step down from sea level and ending with a step up to sea level.
Given the sequence of up and down steps during a hike, find and print the number of valleys walked through.

### Example
 __steps = 8 path = [DDUUUUDD]__

The hiker first enters a valley __2__ units deep. Then they climb out and up onto a mountain __2__ units high. Finally, the hiker returns to sea level and ends the hike.

### Function Description
Complete the countingValleys function in the editor below.

countingValleys has the following parameter(s):

* int steps: the number of steps on the hike
* string path: a string describing the path

### Returns
* int: the number of valleys traversed

### Input Format
The first line contains an integer __steps__, the number of steps in the hike.
The second line contains a single string __path__, of __steps__ characters that describe the path.

### Constraints
* __2 <= steps <= 10e6__
* __path[i] âˆˆ {UD}__

### Sample Input
```
8
UDDDUDUU
```

### Sample Output
```
1
```

### Explanation

If we represent `_` as sea level, a step up as `/`, and a step down as `\`, the hike can be drawn as:
```
_/\      _
   \    /
    \/\/
```
The hiker enters and leaves one valley.
